Anemia Check (C Language)

This is a simple C program that checks for possible anemia based on two inputs:
Hemoglobin level
Fatigue symptoms
The program uses nested if statements to simulate a basic medical decision-making process.

File Included:
anemia_check.c â€” the main C program

How to Run the Program:
Download or clone the repository using this command:
git clone https://github.com/fjprojects/anemia-check.git
Open the file anemia_check.c in any C compiler (such as Code::Blocks, Turbo C, or VS Code)
Compile the code and run it

When prompted, enter:
Hemoglobin level (example: 11.5)
Fatigue status (1 for Yes, 0 for No)

Sample Output:
Enter Hemoglobin level (g/dL): 11.5  
Are you feeling fatigue? (Yes = 1, No = 0): 1  
Low hemoglobin but no fatigue 

About the Project:
This project is part of a simple medical logic series created using the C programming language. It helps beginners understand how to use conditional statements in real-life situations, such as checking for possible anemia.
